        <h1>Starting Some Bigger Projects</h1>
        <p>Published on 18 March, 2019</p>

    <p>Over the past year, and over my entire life, I’ve written a lot of code. Hundreds of repositories on GitHub, many of them public. Hundreds of projects on my local disk as well.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past year and my time making and publishing things on GitHub, I think most of my projects are very small and simple tools.</p>

<p>Take Skyewire for instance: I wrote the code for that in a day, and it’s simply a quick tool that is useful sometimes. I’ve written and built countless projects that are just like that: they are just tools that I wrote in a day.</p>

<p>I haven’t really built and finished a big project. Ever. And I want to start doing that.</p>

<p>So I made an <a href="https://github.com/orvato">organization</a>. That I’m calling Orvato. The purpose of Orvato is to build bigger, better, and more long-term projects. Those ones might take longer to code, but larger scale projects are more ambitious and attract a larger user base than simple “tools”. Larger projects allow for more creativity, and their success is defined by their uniqueness and user attractability.</p>

<p>I think being more creative and being more ambitious is what I need right now, and that’s what I’m doing.</p>

<p>See you later.</p>
