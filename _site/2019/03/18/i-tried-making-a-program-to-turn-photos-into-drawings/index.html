    <p>A couple weeks ago I wrote a pretty simple program using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to turn photos into drawings.</p>

<p>The algorithm is quite simple, and the resulting drawings are meant to imitate impressionism, specifically that of the late 19th century, for example, Manet or Monet.</p>

<p>I was originally going to write a program that made drawings that were “Picasso’s”, where each section of color would be converted into the nearest accurate shape, for example a quadrilateral that fit the section, or a triangle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I realized that the algorithm for that would take a long time, and would significantly increase the already long load times that the algorithm took to run.</p>

<p>So I settled with a simple algorithm which works with a simple simulation of the “magic wand tool”.</p>

<p>Essentially, I have a function that can take a pixel, and run the magic wand tool on it. If you don’t know what the magic wand tool is, it’s simply a tool that allows you to select sections of the same color from a certain pixel.</p>

<p>My algorithm simply selects all the sections of a photo using the magic wand tool and essentially standardizes the color there. So if it had a section of mainly red, it would make all the pixels in that section the same exact color of red.</p>

<p>This algorithm works surprisingly well and manages to resemble impressionism on resulting drawings.</p>

<p>Check out the code here: <a href="https://github.com/xtrp/gh">github.com/xtrp/gh</a>, or try it yourself here: <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/gh/">xtrp.github.io/gh/</a>.</p>
