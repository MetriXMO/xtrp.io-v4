    <p>Modern art is categorized as very simple, yet pleasing and gives a greater message than just an artwork.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been playing around with HTML5 Canvas, with projects like <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/Arjun-April-Steganography">Arjun-April Steganography</a>, <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/arjunsketch/">Arjun Sketch</a>, and <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/pixelart_creator/">PixelArt Creator</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also been working with a lot of randomization with my 2048 AI, <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/jacob/">Jacob</a>, which uses the Monte Carlo Pure Search Tree algorithm, which is based on randomization being perfect.</p>

<p>There are so many cases where randomization makes something so much more perfect and eloquent than complex algorithms.</p>

<p>A prime example of this is AlphaZero, a chess engine built on the Monte Carlo algorithm, which, again, is based on randomization. The algorithm is extremely simple, yet somehow crushed the famous StockFish, an extremely complex chess engine that has been in production for decades, and has been worked on by countless computer science experts, as well as chess grandmasters.</p>

<p>So I decided to try and mix HTML5 Canvas and randomization to create abstract artwork with randomized shapes and opacities and colors.</p>

<p>It isn’t the best, but it looks really cool and it’s fun (at least for me) to reload the page and see what comes up.</p>

<p>See what the world of random gives you.</p>
