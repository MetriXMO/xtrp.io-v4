    <p>Hi! I haven’t written here in a while, mainly because I haven’t been working on any public projects in GitHub in a few weeks — I’ve been working on some private ones which have taken up most of my time.</p>

<p>Luckily, I am back working on public projects and writing on this blog as normal.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago, I finished an open source project called Arjun-April Steganography, which is an online tool that uses a simple steganography technique to encode and decode text in images.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what steganography is, it’s essentially cryptography but for images. Cryptography is hiding and encoding text inside other text, whereas steganography is hiding and encoding text inside images.</p>

<p>So for example, a practical use of steganography could be where a movie producer encodes a persons name into an entire movie before sending it to the person, so that if a copy of the movie is leaked, the movie producer could just decode the movie clip to see who leaked the movie.</p>

<p>Of course the more fun use of steganography is sending encoded and secret messages via plain images.</p>

<p>Arjun-April Steganography is simply a steganography algorithm — a way to encode text inside an image without being noticed.</p>

<p>The algorithm is quite simple: for each pixel, it encodes a number within the last digit of each RGB value in base 6.</p>

<p>So if you wanted to encode the number 15 in the color rgb(125, 86, 45), you would first convert 15 to base 6 (23), then put 23 into the last digit of each RGB value like this: rgb(12<strong>0</strong>, 8<strong>2</strong>, 4<strong>3</strong>).</p>

<p>Decoding is again quite simple — all you have to do is get the last digit of each RGB value and then put them together for each pixel and convert from base 6 to base 10.</p>

<p>But still, here we are just encoding numbers into pixels, but how do we encode text into pixels?</p>

<p>Well text is simply a set of characters, so I opted with using ASCII encoding, which assigns a number to each unique character. Luckily, ASCII encoding only goes up to 95 characters, so I was able to fit every character inside a three digit base 6 number (because base 6 in 3 RGB values).</p>

<p>So I simply wrote all of this in code using HTML5 Canvas and a few file upload scripts that I was able to make via some Stack Overflow research, and it was done!</p>

<p>Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/xtrp/Arjun-April-Steganography">here</a>, or use it <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/Arjun-April-Steganography/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and as for the name, it’s named after a few friends of mine who inspired me to build this pretty amazing piece of software.</p>

<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>
