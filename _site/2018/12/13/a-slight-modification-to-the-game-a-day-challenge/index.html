    <p>Hey. So just 2 days ago I started this challenge where I had to code and release at least one game per day.</p>

<p>After just 2 days of doing this, I have realized that this is quite impractical, and the quality of the games is not going to be very good with the limited time.</p>

<p>As a result, I have make a slight modification to the challenge, which says that I must work on, and make decent progress on at least one game per day.</p>

<p>With this modification, I can make more high quality games, as well as have more time for other, possibly more interesting and fun projects. And any other work I have to do.</p>

<p>Anyway, thatâ€™s all for now.</p>

<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>

<p><strong>Note and Edit: this challenge has been completely discontinued as of December 30, 2018.</strong></p>
