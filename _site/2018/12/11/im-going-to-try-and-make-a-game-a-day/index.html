    <p>Hi. I know I’ve already posted today, but I just started a big (ish) challenge today that I’d thought I’d share with you all.</p>

<p>The challenge is quite simple: I have to release and code one game every day on GitHub.</p>

<p>I’m a bit worried this will take up too much of my time, but otherwise it seems pretty fun.</p>

<p>In the coming days I’m going to release a website showcasing all of my games so far, which I will update daily when I release a new game.</p>

<p>I’ll also periodically talk about some cool games I’ve made on this blog.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just finished my first game (for my first day), which you can see <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/RocketShooter/">here</a>.</p>

<p>My game dev skills aren’t very good at the moment, but I’m hoping this challenge will help me learn some cool techniques and help me learn game dev.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>

<p><strong>Note and Edit: this challenge has been completely discontinued as of December 30, 2018.</strong></p>
