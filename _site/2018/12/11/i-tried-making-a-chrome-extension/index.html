    <p>Hey. So yesterday I wrote a post talking about some software I wrote to encode and decode text hidden inside images.</p>

<p>Just a day after I wrote that website/tool, I tried making a Chrome Extension, and it actually went pretty well and I’m quite proud of the final product.</p>

<p>So the purpose of the Chrome extension was to be able to right click on any image in page and be able to make a meme using that image.</p>

<p>It’s called MemeMachine.</p>

<p>Chrome extensions are surprisingly pretty easy to make; all you need is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> file with all of your configuration and basic extension info, as well as a JavaScript file and any other files in your extension.</p>

<p>My extension consisted of two main files: one to be run in the background of each page, and one to be injected into each page.</p>

<p>The background script created an option in the context menu (menu opened on right click) to make a meme if an image what right clicked on. If that option was clicked, a message was sent to the injected script to show a modal (popup box) with the specified image URL and text boxes for the meme text.</p>

<p>The meme creation and downloading part was done using HTML5 Canvas, and I had to do some pretty cool workarounds to fix several annoying bugs.</p>

<p>For example, when downloading the meme, there was a common error in which sites prohibited CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests, so the photo couldn’t be used in HTML5 Canvas and couldn’t be downloaded. In this case I had to send a message to the background script with the image and meme text, as the background script had the correct permissions and could bypass quite a few different errors regarding security.</p>

<p>Overall, I learned a lot from this project about Chrome extensions in general, as well working with HTML5 Canvas and images.</p>

<p>You can check out MemeMachine <a href="https://xtrp.github.io/MemeMachine/">here</a>, or see it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/xtrp/MemeMachine">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>
