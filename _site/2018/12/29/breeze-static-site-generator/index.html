    <p>Around a year ago, I started experimenting with Jekyll, a static-site generator which uses Ruby and runs seemlessly on and with GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what a static-site generator is: it’s quite simply a script or program that takes a set of site files and compiles them into a site.</p>

<p>For example, in Jekyll, you could say to include a file within another one; for example, the HTML file for the navbar (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav.html</code>) within your homepage (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>), where Jekyll would simply generate the resulting compiled <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> file with the contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav.html</code> included.</p>

<p>Of course, one could argue that static-site generators are useless, as the same results can be achieved with a database, for example PHP and SQL, or Node.js and MongoDB.</p>

<p>However, there quite a few advantages to using static-site generators, namely that static-site generators are databaseless, making load times much faster, and the possibility of databases being hacked impossible as there is no database that can be hacked in the first place.</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried building my own simple static-site generator myself, in Python.</p>

<p>My idea was to build a tool that could run a lot like PHP; in PHP, you can simply insert a starting and closing tag within any <code class="highlighter-rouge">.PHP</code> file and execute PHP within the file.</p>

<p>I built something quite similar, but instead of executing PHP code within a file, it executes Python code.</p>

<p>And instead of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;?</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">?&gt;</code> as the starting and closing tags, my tool (called Breeze) uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;=</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">=&gt;</code>, which, personally, I think looks much cooler.</p>

<p>In addition, my tool provides a way to have a “prerequisite” Python program for the site: a file that is run along with any executed Python code within a file, which is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.py</code>.</p>

<p>Within <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.py</code>, any code can be run; although I personally recommend just using the file to add any variables or functions that will be used in embedded code inside files in the site.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to share that with you all.</p>
