    <p>Hi. So a couple weeks ago (late November) I tried building my own web browser for a semi-ish-friend (I know, just a <strong>semi-ish</strong>-friend) of mine using a tool built by <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> called <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, which allows devs to build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies: specifically frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and NodeJS for the backend, which allows you to run backend-like functions on the users machine.</p>

<p>Electron is built with Chromium, which is the website processing engine that powers <a href="https://chrome.google.com/">Google Chrome</a>, and NodeJS to interact with the file system and the machine.</p>

<p>When I started working on the web browser, I honestly thought that I could just work on building the UI and some cool features, but little did I know that I had some really annoying stuff ahead of me.</p>

<p>So for the web browser, I used the HTML <code class="highlighter-rouge">webview</code> tag to show each webpage and tab. Webviews are pretty easy to use with JavaScript, and are quite effective for the purposes of this project.</p>

<p>But unlike what I thought, webviews only display the website. Nothing more. I mean <strong>nothing</strong> more. They don’t allow for links to be opened in new tabs, and they don’t account for the numerous problems that I’ve encountered with website compatibility, for example the fact that I had to enable a bunch of web-security and node-sandbox features to get Google Drive working, and the fact that watching Netflix is near impossible without injecting a bunch of CDM scripts (yeah guys, switch to Hulu).</p>

<p>And even after fixing most website compatibility issues (which I haven’t fully done yet in fact), there are some more things that need to be added, for example: printing a website, saving a website, saving history, saving cookies, context menus (options that show up when you right click), favicons (icon/logo that shows up on the top-left of the tab), and so much more.</p>

<p>In addition, Electron doesn’t even have standard shortcuts like Cmd+C or Cmd+V built-in (at least with a custom menu-bar); you have to make them yourself, which is really annoying and very time consuming.</p>

<p>And after you’ve done all that, then you can start working on the UI and features for your browser.</p>

<p>In all, I spent literally upwards of 4 to 5 hours working on this browser, and it’s not even close to finished. I still haven’t fixed Netflix. Or something like 15 other really popular websites.</p>

<p>So in the end, I have a new level of respect and love for the Google Chrome team. Also the Safari team. And maybe even the Internet Explorer team (although I think they’ve been disbanded or moved because IE has been discontinued).</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ll hopefully be releasing this web browser within the next few days, and hopefully it’ll have most popular sites working, as well as a few cool features that set it apart from Chrome and other popular browsers.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>
