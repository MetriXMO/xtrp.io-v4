        <h1>Top 5 Text Editors for Web Dev</h1>
        <p>Published on 20 August, 2018</p>
    </div>
    <p>Over the past few years I’ve used quite a few text editors. In this post, I’ve made a list on the ones that I think are the best.</p>

<p>Note that this is my opinion only, and I recommend that you take a look at the features of each text editor, and decide for yourself which one you think is the best.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, this is the list.</p>

<h3 id="1-visual-studio-code">1. Visual Studio Code</h3>

<p>Not to be confused with the popular C++ IDE Visual Studio, VSCode comes with a large set of packages and themes, support for syntax highlighting for thousands of languages, and a friendly but fully featured interface.</p>

<p>VSCode starts up pretty quick, although not as fast as other alternatives (ie. Atom or Sublime), and upon opening, you see a screen where you have a few options.
VSCode comes preinstalled with syntax highlighting for all of the main programming technologies, but you can also download additional syntax highlighting support for other languages via the package management tab.</p>

<p>Along with basic syntax highlighting, Emmet, a popular web development shortcut tool, comes preinstalled with VSCode, which is actually pretty handy in some situations. However, Emmet can easily be installed in many other popular text editors as well.</p>

<p>VSCode also comes with a very sophisticated debugging tool, unlike any other. The debugging tool is one of the most useful in VSCode as a whole, and in my opinion, is what separates VSCode from other popular text editors.</p>

<p>Additionally, VSCode was built using Electron, the tool that Github created that allows desktop apps to be built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js). This means that the VSCode settings are actually in a JSON format, which makes the setting a lot easier to edit, as the format is familiar to most (if not all) web developers.</p>

<p>All in all, VSCode comes with all of the great features of all of the other popular text editors, but is faster, more sophisticated, and updated regularly.</p>

<h3 id="2-atom">2. Atom</h3>

<p>Atom was created by Github not so long ago, and is very similar to VSCode in several ways.</p>

<p>First of all, Atom has and extremely well designed user interface, with easy to edit settings, and a wide amount of keyboard shortcut options.</p>

<p>Atom also has a large community of people building Atom packages and themes, which are easy to install (and uninstall) via the packages and themes tab.</p>

<p>Among these packages and themes, Emmet is available, of course.</p>

<p>Not long ago, the Atom team developed a very useful package for Atom, called Atom Teletype.</p>

<p>Atom Teletype allows developers to collaborate on code in real time, giving programmers a “Google Docs” type experience, using just one pin.</p>

<p>This can be very useful in a work environment, if you’d like to work on the same project or file with a co-worker.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would recommend Atom to semi-experienced developers that are looking for a text editor to make programming significantly faster, but isn’t too overkill.</p>

<h3 id="3-sublime-text">3. Sublime Text</h3>

<p>Sublime Text is an extremely lightweight, but still functional text editor.</p>

<p>Sublime boots up lightning fast, and has all the basic tools any developer needs — a file management toolbar, quick file multitasking, and most of all, easy code editing. The Sublime Text user interface is extremely simple and easy to use, but with that said, Sublime isn’t that sophisticated.</p>

<p>The package management system is quite complicated to understand (and hard to find), and Sublime only supports a few languages for syntax highlighting.</p>

<p>I would say that Sublime Text is the best text editor for beginners, as it is simple to use, but doesn’t have many advanced features.</p>

<h3 id="4-brackets">4. Brackets</h3>

<p>Brackets was created by Adobe a few years back, and it some pretty great features that really separate it from other text editors.</p>

<p>On its own, Brackets has all of the basic tools of a text editor. It has good syntax highlighting, a whole library of packages and themes, as well as a simple user interface.</p>

<p>Along with all of these features, it has a few unique ones.</p>

<p>First, Brackets comes with a live editor pre-installed.</p>

<p>Basically, you can click a button, and live view of your website is displayed on Google Chrome.</p>

<p>Upon changing the current file, the live view will reload automatically.</p>

<p>On top of that, the live view highlights the HTML element that your cursor is on in Brackets, so that you can see what you are changing, in real time.</p>

<p>Another great feature in Brackets is the “Inline Support” feature.</p>

<p>All you have to do is press Ctrl-E (or Cmd-E) and you can view all of the CSS affecting the HTML element your cursor in currently on. This can be useful if you want to quickly edit the styles of an element without having to go to your CSS file and find the style declaration.</p>

<p>You can also press Ctrl-E (or Cmd-E) while your cursor is on a color (eg. #fff), and brackets shows you a interactive color picker, which can be very useful in some situations.</p>

<p>Overall, Brackets is a pretty great text editor that I would definitely recommend for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="5-webstorm">5. Webstorm</h3>

<p>Webstorm is probably the best text editor on this list. It has great support for debugging, a library of thousands of packages, amazing syntax highlighting support, and a bunch of other really useful features.</p>

<h4 id="right-now-you-might-be-thinking-why-didnt-you-put-webstorm-at-1">Right now, you might be thinking “Why didn’t you put Webstorm at #1?”</h4>

<p>Well, a license for Webstorm costs $130 per year, and honestly, the extra features that Webstorm has compared to VSCode aren’t really worth $130 per year.</p>

<p>If you’re already a successful and experienced web developer with a couple hundred bucks to spare, Webstorm could be for you.</p>

<p>Jetbrains, the creator of Webstorm, also has a variety of other IDEs, and a license for all of them is only $600, so if you do a lot of programming in a large array of languages, you could simply just pay for the full license, and get a code editor for each of the languages you use.</p>

<p>Jetbrains also updates Webstorm and other editors regularly, and many top-notch companies, such as Twitter, Valve, and HP use their products as their main code editors.</p>

<h3 id="so-thats-my-list">So, that’s my list!</h3>

<p>That’s all for my list of best text editors.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I suggest you look at all of the features of each editor and choose the one that you like the most, because, as much as I hate to say it, my opinion is not fact.</p>

<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>
