    <div class="post">
        <p class="post_description">So a little while back I did a presentation where I programmed snake in front of around 50 people in under 5 minutes (I managed it in 4:42). The program was written from scratch in just HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, all in one file. So what did I do to go so quickly? Well, I spent a while making the program as short as possible. I got rid of everything that wasn’t needed... <a href="/2018/08/22/how-i-coded-snake-in-under-5-minutes/">(more)</a></p>

        <p class="post_description">Over the past few years I’ve used quite a few text editors. In this post, I’ve made a list on the ones that I think are the best. Note that this is my opinion only, and I recommend that you take a look at the features of each text editor, and decide for yourself which one you think is the best.

    <div class="post">
        <p class="post_description">Cross Site Scripting, or XSS attacks are a very common type of attack hackers can use to inject code on to your website, if you don’t have the proper protection. XSS attacks are extremely common. In fact, according to High-Tech Bridge, a web security company, Cross Site Scripting attacks account for around 80% of all website security flaws. What is XSS?

        <p class="post_description">Hi, my name is Fred Adams. I’ve been programming for quite a few years now (around 5 I think), and over that time I’ve learned many programming languages and technologies. I mainly focus on web development, but I also program in Python, and some Java and C++. This blog is a place where I’ll (hopefully) write about code and maybe a few tutorials and thoughts on different programming languages and technologies. I’ll probably write mostly... <a href="/2018/08/15/a-quick-introduction/">(more)</a></p>
