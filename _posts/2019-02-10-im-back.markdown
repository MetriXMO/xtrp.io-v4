title: "I'm Back!"
---

Hi. So I realize I haven't posted on this blog in literally *a month*. I'm sorry.

In the beginning of January, I built a few pretty great projects, such as my 2048 AI, [Jacob](https://xtrp.github.io/jacob/).

In mid-January, I took a break from coding. Other things came up in my life, and coding was pushed away.

But now, after around a month, I'm back. I haven't coded properly in a while, so I've got to catch up. My typing speed isn't as fast; I've forgotten some commands, but I'm so happy to be back writing code again.

Getting coding again is my top priority right now. I want to focus on building something beautiful. Something bigger. Something better. And I won't let anyone or anything stop me.

I'm going to start small, but I want to create something that's better than anything else I've made before. Anything else I made in 2018 or 2017 or 2016.

I'm also hoping to post on this blog more. I realize I've said that quite a few times; but I'm serious. I want to find consistency in posting here.

Regardless, I'm back, and I'll post any updates or new projects as they come.

Thanks for scrolling.
