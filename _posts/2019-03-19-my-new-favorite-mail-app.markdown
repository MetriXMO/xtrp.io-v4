title: "MailSpring: My New Favorite Email App"
---

Hey. So I actually have a few email accounts, which I check often.

Over the past few years, I’ve simply used the online email portal (e.g. gmail.com or inbox.google.com). I’d seen people use the default Mail app for macOS or the Mail app for Windows, but frankly, I found those nothing more than just a container for the web email versions.

But just a few days ago, I downloaded an email client called MailSpring. MailSpring is great for quite a few notable reasons.

The first, and I think most important one being it’s cross-platform compatibility: it is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The functionality on all three platforms is exactly the same, and MailSpring runs seamlessely on all of them.

MailSpring works just like any other mail app, and it allows you to have multiple email accounts running simultaneously. Basic features like composing an email and replying to an email are of course present on MailSpring, along with a few extra features that frankly, make MailSpring my favorite mail app.

MailSpring has read receipts automatically enabled, so you can see when someone opens an email, even if they are opening it for the second or third time. MailSpring also has an option to change the theme of the app, with a few built in ones like the Light and Dark themes, and while the built in ones are already great, you can download and run different and more unique themes yourself. If you’d like, you can even build your own MailSpring theme.

MailSpring allows for extensive customization of the applications user interface and design. You can switch from a dual-panel layout to a single-panel layout depending on your preference, you have the ability to change the app font size, and, of course, as mentioned earlier, you can add and use different MailSpring themes to make your email client fit your mood or personality.

MailSpring also offers a great set of templates for email signatures: my favorite one being the one with the profile picture and name (shoot me an email at [xtrp127@gmail.com](mailto:someone@example.com?Subject=Hey!)).

And of course, this is only what I’ve discovered about MailSpring in just 2 or 3 days.

Get MailSpring here: [getmailspring.com](https://getmailspring.com/); oh, and it’s also open sourced on Github here: [github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring).
