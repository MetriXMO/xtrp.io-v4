title: "I'm Going to Try and Make a Game a Day"
---

Hi. I know I've already posted today, but I just started a big (ish) challenge today that I'd thought I'd share with you all.

The challenge is quite simple: I have to release and code one game every day on GitHub.

I'm a bit worried this will take up too much of my time, but otherwise it seems pretty fun.

In the coming days I'm going to release a website showcasing all of my games so far, which I will update daily when I release a new game.

I'll also periodically talk about some cool games I've made on this blog.

Anyway, I just finished my first game (for my first day), which you can see [here](https://xtrp.github.io/RocketShooter/).

My game dev skills aren't very good at the moment, but I'm hoping this challenge will help me learn some cool techniques and help me learn game dev.

Wish me luck!

Thanks for scrolling.
