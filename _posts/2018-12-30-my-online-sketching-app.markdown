title: "My Online Sketching App"
---

Hi. So a couple weeks ago I built my own online sketching app using HTML5 Canvas.

I feel like in the past few weeks I've gotten much more comfortable using HTML5 Canvas, and I've found that it's really useful in some situations; especially with JavaScript client-side image editing and manipulation.

The sketching app is pretty simple: it gives you a blank, 4:3 ratio white canvas, and you can draw using the crosshair cursor.

There are also a couple options: you can change the brush color, as well as the thickness (stroke width).

In addition, there is an undo function, and a download button that allows you to download a PNG file of your sketch.

Anyway, check out the app [here](https://xtrp.github.io/arjunsketch/) or see it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/xtrp/arjunsketch).

Thanks for scrolling.
