title: "Starting Some Bigger Projects"
---

Over the past year, and over my entire life, I've written a lot of code. Hundreds of repositories on GitHub, many of them public. Hundreds of projects on my local disk as well.

Reflecting on the past year and my time making and publishing things on GitHub, I think most of my projects are very small and simple tools.

Take Skyewire for instance: I wrote the code for that in a day, and it's simply a quick tool that is useful sometimes. I've written and built countless projects that are just like that: they are just tools that I wrote in a day.

I haven't really built and finished a big project. Ever. And I want to start doing that.

So I made an [organization](https://github.com/orvato). That I'm calling Orvato. The purpose of Orvato is to build bigger, better, and more long-term projects. Those ones might take longer to code, but larger scale projects are more ambitious and attract a larger user base than simple "tools". Larger projects allow for more creativity, and their success is defined by their uniqueness and user attractability.

I think being more creative and being more ambitious is what I need right now, and that's what I'm doing.

See you later.
