Hi, my name is Fred Adams.

I've been programming for quite a few years now (around 5 I think), and over that time I've learned many programming languages and technologies.

I mainly focus on web development, but I also program in Python, and some Java and C++.

This blog is a place where I'll (hopefully) write about code and maybe a few tutorials and thoughts on different programming languages and technologies.

I'll probably write mostly about web development, although I might on occasion write about other programming languages, or even some other unrelated topics.

I won't write and post too often &mdash; don't expect me to write every other day or something, but I'll try to be consistent and at least write once or twice a week.

Anyway, stay tuned, and thanks for scrolling.
