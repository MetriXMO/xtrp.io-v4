Hi. When I first started this blog, I intended it to be a place where I would write tutorials about web developers at different levels. Unfortunately, in the end, it didn't work out.

I've decided to just make this blog a place where I can talk about my latest programming projects and websites that I've built lately, and other things that I'd like to write about.

I'll also be updating this website more often with more posts and updates to the projects page with my latest projects.

In regard to the tutorials, I have been working on a new tutorials site called Coding DeMystified, which is on GitHub and at [xtrp.github.io/codingdemystified](https://xtrp.github.io/codingdemystified/).

I've only written one tutorial on Coding DeMystified, but I'll be writing a lot more soon (I hope).

Anyway, that's all for now.

Thanks for scrolling (or not because this post was so short).
