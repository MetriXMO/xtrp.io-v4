title: "A Few Ideas for Programming Side Projects"

I really think that side projects are vital in learning programming. They allow you to implement the skills and technologies that you've learned in a cool way.

But a lot of times (at least for me), it's hard to find ideas for side projects. So I've written a short list of side projects you could program, in no particular order.

## An HTML Game

You could write your own game. In HTML, or Python (Pygame), or whatever language you'd like.

I wrote a simple snake game ([xtrp.github.io/snake](https://xtrp.github.io/snake/)) myself that really boosted my learning.

## A Personal Website

You could make your own personal website and host it on GitHub Pages &mdash; so the site would be at [ your GitHub username ].github.io.

You could even make your own blog as well (like I did) with Jekyll, a static-site generator that runs seemlessly with GitHub Pages.

This could also be a good way to put yourself and your projects out there and show the rest of the coding and GitHub community what you've made.

## A Chrome Extension

Chrome Extensions are actually pretty easy to make, as they only really need an HTML file and a few pieces of metadata and setup information.

You can make a Chrome Extension for anything: a game, a useful tool (e.g. Grammarly), or a productivity monitor.

I myself made a Chrome Extension for editing any site by editing the "contentEditable" HTML attribute to "true" using JavaScript.

## An API

This might be for more experienced developers, but you could build your own API for anything &mdash; maybe a jokes API, or news API, or anything you might be interested in.

## An AI for a Famous Game

You could make an AI to play a famous game like Chess, Checkers, or 2048.

For Chess, I personally recommend starting out with a simple implementation of the Minimax algorithm and then adding Alpha-Beta pruning.

I myself have tried making an AI to play Chess, although it wasn't very good. I might try again and put it on GitHub.

## A Desktop App

If you're like me and enjoy building websites and web apps with HTML (and CSS and JS), you could build your own desktop app with a pretty neat framework called Electron, which allows you to have web containers inside desktop apps that can interact seemlessly with native tools like the WebCam, file system, and more with Node.js.

You could make a chat app, backup and sync app, or even a web browser.

## Done!

Well, that's all I have for now.

Thanks for scrolling.
