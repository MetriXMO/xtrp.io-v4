title: "A Slight Modification to the Game-a-Day Challenge"
---

Hey. So just 2 days ago I started this challenge where I had to code and release at least one game per day.

After just 2 days of doing this, I have realized that this is quite impractical, and the quality of the games is not going to be very good with the limited time.

As a result, I have make a slight modification to the challenge, which says that I must work on, and make decent progress on at least one game per day.

With this modification, I can make more high quality games, as well as have more time for other, possibly more interesting and fun projects. And any other work I have to do.

Anyway, that's all for now.

Thanks for scrolling.
