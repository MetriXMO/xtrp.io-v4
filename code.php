<div class="block" id="introduction">
    <p>I've been coding for around 5 years now. I started out programming using the popular language <a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, but have since moved on to working with programming languages like JavaScript to built websites and web applications.</p>
    <p>I honestly build anything and everything that I feel like building &mdash; from games to useful tools, to open source projects. I've just recently started experimenting with mobile app development with <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/" target="_blank">Java</a> development.</p>
    <p>Below is every open-sourced bundle of pixels I've built since February 27, 2018. Check out what I've done! And by the way, you can also see all of these on my <a href="https://github.com/xtrp/" target="_blank">GitHub Profile</a>.</p>
