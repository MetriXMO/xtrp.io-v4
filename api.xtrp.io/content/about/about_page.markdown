# Hi, I'm Fred Adams!

I am a young developer (currently starting high school), who is constantly building new things and experimenting with new programming languages and technologies.

I've been writing code for half a decade now, and I've built quite a few things along the way.

## A Semi-Brief History

I started off working with Python in 2014, then moving on to web development a year later. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with basic PHP, and Jekyll, a static-site generator written with Ruby.

I started off building a few simple sites, with my first real useful site being [Skyewire](https://xtrp.github.io/skyewire/), which allows users to share text instantly via a quick pin number. In the span of a few months, I went on to build a site for customizing and editing Hex and RGB values, called [Hex RGB Creator](https://xtrp.github.io/Hex-RGB-Creator/), a [Jekyll Theme called Cobalt](https://github.com/xtrp/Cobalt-Jekyll-Theme), and [HTML 5 Rocket](https://html5rocket.github.io/), a collection of free, CC0 licensed HTML5 site templates.

My first major published website was xtrp.github.io, my previous personal website, written with Ruby and Jekyll. It included a blog, and a few links to projects I built.

In the Summer of 2018, I started to build more complex websites and web apps. I built a to-do list web app called [Blaze](https://xtrp.github.io/blaze/), a JavaScript practicing website called [InstCode](https://xtrp.github.io/instcode/), and a political news aggregator and politician indexer called [Capitol Net](https://xtrp.github.io/capitolnet/). I would consider Capitol Net to be my first major glimpse into the experience of building a complex web app.

During the Winter of 2018/2019, I built quite a few more complex sites and programs. I built a Python-based static site generator called [Breeze](https://github.com/xtrp/breeze/), and an AI to play the popular game 2048, called [Jacob](https://xtrp.github.io/jacob/), among several others.

In the Summer of 2019, I started posting to my current site at xtrp.io, and built that site pretty quickly. Later that Summer, I built a web app for my schools Student Council, which allows students to submit ideas and vote on them to make a real impact on the school. I called the web app [Your Voice, Your Vote](https://example.com/).

And that's where we are now!

## What's Next

I am in a great place right now. I'm learning more than ever, and starting to understand the key components of full-stack web development more and more.

I'm currently rebuilding xtrp.io with a new design and all-new open-sourced MVC architecture. That is likely the version of the site you are seeing right now!

I am learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a popular PHP framework, I'm working on a desktop application, and, I'm learning hybrid app development with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

There is so much to be done, and this is just the beginning.

I am young, and I have a lot to learn, a lot to build, and hopefully, a lot to achieve in the near future.

I update [my blog](/blog/) on this site regularly with updates on everything in the world of Fred Adams, and you can also check out [my projects](/projects/).

Also, I urge you to see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/xtrp/), where I open-source most of my projects, and also check out my [DEV.to](https://dev.to/xtrp/) profile, where I post my most notable blog posts.

I've worked hard on this site, and I hope you have a great time browsing it!
